### Order products

`order_products__*.csv`

These files specify which products were purchased in each order.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sc, 
"SELECT * 
FROM order_products__prior_tbl 
LIMIT 10")
```
 
## orders

`orders.csv`

This file tells to which set (prior, train, test) an order belongs. 


```{r}
orders_prev <- dbGetQuery(sc, 
"SELECT * 
FROM orders_tbl 
LIMIT 100")
orders_prev
```
 
```{r}
dbGetQuery(
  sc,
  "
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_id) AS products
FROM order_products__prior_tbl
  "
  )
```

```{r}
products_popularity_txt <- "
SELECT product_id
,   COUNT(1) AS n_orders
FROM order_products__prior_tbl
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY n_orders DESC
LIMIT 50

products_popularity <-

## Questions

* Which day of week people order most fequently?

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sc,

```

* The most popular hour of doing order? 
* The most reordered products?
* The less reorderd product?
